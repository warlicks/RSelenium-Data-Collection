## RSelenium Data Collection
This repository provides an example of using [**RSelenium**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/index.html) to collect data from the web.  The repository contains two files.  

1. RSelenium.Rmd, which was used to create the article at [Let's Ask the Data](https://seanwarlick.wordpress.com).  

2. RSelenium Example.R, which contains the R code from the article in an executable format.
